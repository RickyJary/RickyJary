# Hi, I'm RickyJary ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I am Ricardo, a highly motivated individual with a strong passion for technology, creativity, and leadership. My professional journey has been shaped by diverse experiences, from administrative roles requiring precision and problem-solving to leading a music group that toured across Europe for over a decade. These opportunities have refined my ability to adapt, motivate others, and bring ideas to life.

Currently, I am transitioning into the tech industry, combining my background in communication and leadership with a newfound love for programming. Through my web development training at Ironhack and hands-on projects, Iâ€™ve developed skills in building user-friendly applications and managing complex systems. I thrive on solving challenges, both technical and creative, and aspire to lead impactful projects, particularly in digital product development and gaming.

I take pride in being approachable, empathetic, and always willing to help. Whether collaborating with a team or working independently, I bring energy, focus, and an eagerness to learn. My ultimate goal is to create digital experiences that leave a lasting impression, and I am excited to continue growing in this dynamic field.
